            ## Self-Heal PR

            This PR was created automatically by the weekly self-heal workflow.

            **What happened:**
            - `ruff check --fix` auto-fixed lint issues
            - `ruff format` standardized formatting

            **Verification:**
            - All quality gates (ruff + mypy + pytest) pass after fixes

            Review and merge if the changes look correct.
